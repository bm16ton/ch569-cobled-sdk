A very quick and dirty copy and paiste of files from hydrausb and official wch files. The hydrausb fw folder is currently a usb2cdc experiment. All ive done so far is add usb descriptors for it to enumerate as usbcdc device. I also copied sum stuff for the UART from official examples. I didmt have much time and for a start just wanted the log printed over the cdc interface....Which it does but it also prints a ton of gibberish as well. Hopefully will get moe time someday soon to continue.

Added teenyusb folder, With sum very basic patches needed for it to compile, sum required patches given to me by the great Benjamin Vernoux, and a Makefile for the winusb30 ch565 example and a forest gumped board.mk file. Long short it compiles loads and enumerates, unfortunatly the host app is windows only and id rather cut off my foot. So a nerw different teenyusb example is required.Also not sure when combining the hydrausb code who should take precedence.
