A very quick and dirty copy and paiste of files from hydrausb and official wch files. The hydrausb fw folder is currently a usb2cdc experiment. All ive done so far is add usb descriptors for it to enumerate as usbcdc device. I also copied sum stuff for the UART from official examples. I didmt have much time and for a start just wanted the log printed over the cdc interface....Which it does but it also prints a ton of gibberish as well. Hopefully will get moe time someday soon to continue.
